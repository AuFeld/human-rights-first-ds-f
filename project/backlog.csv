ST. LOUIS (AP) — A grand jury on Tuesday indicted the St. Louis couple who displayed guns while hundreds of racial injustice protesters marched on their private street.

Al Watkins, an attorney for the couple, confirmed to The Associated Press the indictments against Mark McCloskey, 63, and Patricia McCloskey, 61. A spokeswoman for Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner declined comment.

The McCloskeys, who are both attorneys, have become folk heroes among some conservatives. They argue that they were simply exercising their Second Amendment right to bear arms, and were protected by Missouri’s castle doctrine law that allows the use of deadly force against intruders. The case has caught the attention of President Donald Trump, and Republican Missouri Gov. Mike Parson has said he will pardon the couple if they are convicted.

The McCloskeys also were featured speakers on the first night of the Republican National Convention. They’ve accused the “leftist” Democratic St. Louis leadership for their plight.

Gardner, a Democrat, charged the couple with felony unlawful use of a weapon. She said the display of guns risked bloodshed at what she called an otherwise peaceful protest.

Watkins said that in addition to the weapons charge, the grand jury indictment includes a tampering with evidence charge. It wasn’t clear what led to that additional count, he said.

The McCloskeys contend the protest was hardly peaceful. They say protesters came onto the private street after knocking over an iron gate and ignoring a “No Trespassing” sign, and said they felt threatened.

Watkins said accusations against the McCloskeys are “effectively demonstrating the highest degree of ineptitude and inappropriate behavior” from Gardner’s office.

The incident happened June 28 as protesters were walking toward the home of Mayor Lyda Krewson, a few blocks away. They suddenly decided to veer onto the McCloskeys’ street, prompting the confrontation that was caught on cellphone video. It showed Mark McCloskey in front of the $1.15 million home armed with an AR-15 rifle and Patricia McCloskey with a semiautomatic handgun.

A police probable cause statement said protesters feared “being injured due to Patricia McCloskey’s finger being on the trigger, coupled with her excited demeanor.”

Nine people involved in the protest were charged with misdemeanor trespassing, but the city counselor’s office later dropped the charges. The city counselor’s office handles lesser crimes and is not affiliated with the circuit attorney’s office.

Mark McCloskey, after a brief court hearing earlier Tuesday, expressed anger that he and his wife faced criminal charges while those who trespassed onto his property did not.

“Every single human being that was in front of my house was a criminal trespasser,” McCloskey said. “They broke down our gate. They trespassed on our property. Not a single one of those people is now charged with anything. We’re charged with felonies that could cost us four years of our lives and our law licenses.”

j3d4ia,Oregon,Portland,2020-10-01T00:00:00,US Justice Department cracks down on Portland protesters with law from Civil Rights Era,"At the end of August, in a green leafy park in Northeast Portland, Renn Cannon laid out a new effort surrounding incidents at racial justice protests.

“The FBI is going to take a larger role in investigating these nightly acts of violence,” the special agent in charge of the FBI’s Portland field office said.

At the time, Cannon said he was concerned about the toll protests were having on the city.

“What I’m letting people know is we’re expanding that investigative footprint,” he said. “After 90 days, the cumulative effects are becoming more and more severe. And that’s the role of the federal government: to help with problems where the public’s safety is in danger.”

The U.S. Department of Justice has expanded its resources in the city of Portland. The agency’s goal was to bring criminal cases against people who it believes have broken the law amid nightly racial justice protests that have now entered their fifth month. But in some cases, the federal government is acting more like a local prosecutor, and some say that is going too far.

So far, the U.S. attorney’s office in Oregon has brought more than 90 federal charges, mostly misdemeanors either involving federal officers or federal property.

But this month, for the first time, the office brought new charges against protesters — ones that didn’t have a clear federal connection.

“We’re doing it because we believe in having an impact at ending this violence; that’s why we’re doing it,” Oregon’s U.S. Attorney Billy Williams said. “We’re looking at every tool available.”

Those new cases revolve around civil disorder charges, and they signal a shift at the Department of Justice to a more aggressive approach against protesters.

In one case, the FBI said a protester allegedly used a slingshot to strike a Portland firefighter with a ball bearing. In a separate case, the FBI alleges a protester threw a helmet at a Portland police officer, hitting the officer, who was also wearing a helmet.

Those incidents, and others like them, didn’t take place on federal property and didn’t involve threats to federal law enforcement. But federal prosecutors argue they’re able to charge the cases because the so-called civil disorder prevents interstate commerce, in this case blocking roads.

Williams said FBI agents have combed through hundreds of arrests by local police, looking for possible federal charges.

“And we continue to look through,” he told OPB.

So far, federal prosecutors have focused civil disorder charges against those protesting police. It’s a little-used charge passed by Congress in 1968. At the time, some pro-segregationist U.S. senators wanted the federal government to be able to crack down on the civil rights movement.

“It’s tragically ironic that the federal government is using this civil disorder statute,” said Lisa Hay, the federal public defender for the District of Oregon. “I mean when you look back to the Congressional record, it has such racist overtones when it was passed. ... It’s terrible to be using this statute for this kind of protest.”

Hay represents protesters, including those charged more recently with civil disorder. She argues these charges go too far and show the federal government ignoring state sovereignty.

“The U.S. attorney is appointed by the president,” Hay said. “He’s not accountable to the people of Oregon in any way. So that’s where there’s a concern, when the federal government steps in and starts prosecuting cases that could be prosecuted in the county. And I don’t want to guess on the motivations, but obviously, the U.S. attorney reports to Washington D.C. And this U.S. attorney’s office is definitely aggressively prosecuting what they perceive to be federal crimes.”

In May, newly elected Multnomah County District Attorney Mike Schmidt was elected with nearly 77% of the vote.

Just after taking office in August, Schmidt declined to prosecute nonviolent crimes at protests because he said it could be seen as stifling First Amendment rights. The result: hundreds of protest related arrests were dismissed.

Schmidt declined interview requests to talk about federal prosecutions, but he did speak about his policy this month on OPB’s “Think Out Loud.” (Listen to the interview by clicking the play button below.)

“I was sending a signal and saying this is where I’m going to put our resources: to people that are causing harm and violence,” Schmidt said. “We can actually do damage to the legitimacy of the criminal justice system if we are seen being heavy headed, potentially chilling legitimate speech that is critical of this very system.”

Schmidt’s policy has angered many in law enforcement.

During the last several months, the U.S. Marshals Service deputized more than 100 local law enforcement officers, including Oregon State Police troopers, Multnomah County Sheriff deputies and Portland Police officers. For the rest of the year that gives local police the option of sending cases directly to federal prosecutors rather than going through Schmidt’s office.

Late Tuesday, Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler, who is also the city’s police commissioner, asked Williams to de-deputize Portland police. Williams rejected that request, saying the deputations are needed to end “dangerous conditions prevalent in downtown Portland due to a lack of leadership.”",['https://www.opb.org/article/2020/10/01/us-justice-department-cracks-down-on-portland-protesters-with-law-from-civil-rights-era/'],"{'lat': 45.5371, 'long': -122.65}"
j4e5ys,California,San Francisco,2020-10-03T05:19:51+00:00,Better weather won't keep California from grim fire landmark,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Red flag warnings of extreme fire danger subsided, but warm and dry weather continued to challenge firefighters battling more than two dozen blazes across California on Saturday as the state approaches an astonishing milestone: 4 million acres burned by wildfires this year.

The state is about 20,000 acres from reaching the unprecedented figure, fire officials said. Meanwhile, two major fires that have killed four people and incinerated hundreds of homes in the wine country and the far north continued to burn.

Powerful winds that had been expected to drive flames since Wednesday hadn’t materialized, and warnings of extreme fire danger for hot, dry and gusty weather expired Saturday morning as a layer of fog rolled in. Clearer skies in some areas allowed large air tankers to drop retardant after being sidelined by smoky conditions several days earlier.

But with California a tinderbox of dead trees and dried brush after weeks of scorching weather and years of drought, fires could explode in rural areas, grasslands and dense forest even without the push of winds.

Above-normal temperatures and low humidity persisted Saturday, heightening the fire danger.

“It just leaves us kind of nervous that we’re not out of the woods yet when it comes to what might happen in California,” said Jonathan Cox, a deputy chief with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, known as Cal Fire.

A cooling trend is expected to slowly begin on Sunday. Long-range forecast models hinted at the possibility of rain early next week.

The easing winds proved a mixed blessing at the Glass Fire in Sonoma and Napa counties. Although the fire raged on, crews got a break as they struggled to keep flames from jumping containment lines and renewing their march toward scenic communities.

“The good news is that with the lack of wind, we didn’t have continued control issues,” said Ben Nicholls, a Cal Fire division chief.

“However,” he added, “due to that lack of wind, the smoke has stayed in place” and hindered aircraft from attacking the blaze.

Evacuation orders for many of the 5,000 residents of Calistoga were reduced Friday to warnings, although trees and some homes on the town borders were burning.

The fire, which had destroyed about 600 homes and other buildings, still threatened around 29,000 homes.

The fire had burned 97.4 square miles (252 square kilometers) and was only 10% contained.

In Shasta County in the north end of the state, the Zogg Fire that began Sunday has killed four people and destroyed nearly 180 structures. Containment slightly grew to 57% contained.

Two inmate firefighters were injured Friday afternoon and were airlifted from a steep area in the northern zone of the fire to a local hospital, incident commander Sean Kavanaugh said.

One was released while the other remained hospitalized Saturday, Kavanaugh said.

Altogether, wildfires have killed 31 people and destroyed 8,200 structures in California this year. Many of the largest fires were started by lightning strikes in mid-August and most of the destroyed acreage has come since then.

About 17,000 firefighters are still battling nearly two dozen major blazes.

Numerous studies have linked bigger wildfires in the U.S. to climate change from the burning of coal, oil and gas. Scientists say climate change has made California much drier, meaning trees and other plants are more flammable.",['https://apnews.com/article/wildfires-fires-california-archive-weather-3246c2a601007f57481f861631d66c76'],"{'lat': 37.7562, 'long': -122.443}"
